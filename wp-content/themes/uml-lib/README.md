uml-lib Theme
===
## Use this theme as base for other themes
1. Download `uml-lib` from GitHub
2. Copy the `uml-lib` directory and rename to a new name
3. 5-step find and replace on the name in all the templates

#### Renaming based on underscores steps:
1. Search for `'_s'` (inside single quotations) to capture the text domain.
2. Search for `_s_` to capture all the function names.
3. Search for `Text Domain: _s` in `style.css`.
4. Search for <code>&nbsp;_s</code> (with a space before it) to capture DocBlocks.
5. Search for `_s-` to capture prefixed handles.

OR

1. Search for: `'_s'` and replace with: `'megatherium-is-awesome'`
2. Search for: `_s_` and replace with: `megatherium_is_awesome_`
3. Search for: `Text Domain: _s` and replace with: `Text Domain: megatherium-is-awesome` in `style.css`.
4. Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium_is_Awesome</code>
5. Search for: `_s-` and replace with: `megatherium-is-awesome-`

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css`, the links in `footer.php` with your own information and rename `_s.pot` from `languages` folder to use the theme's slug. Next, update or delete this readme.

## Continue set up of your renamed theme
* Be sure to have dev dependencies on your machine: Node, NPM, BrowserSync, Gulp

* Run in your theme directory: 
    * npm install
    * change path for browser sync in gulpconfig.json if applicable
    * gulp copy-assets

* Now you are ready to develop your theme
    * gulp
    * gulp clean
    * gulp bundle -- when ready for distribution into other wp installs

### About _s, or underscores
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` just add the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/template-functions.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
Note: `.no-sidebar` styles are not automatically loaded.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
